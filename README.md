Details: For New Vehicles and Used Vehicle pages, cards display each vehicle in that specific inventory with picture and details. Option to place a bid on the vehicle is displayed only if that vehicle has been in inventory for 120+ days from current date. 
For Best Deals page, cards display info for vehicles which have been in their inventory for 120+ days and thus are eligible for bid at a 90% discount rate. 

#### Placing a Bid

Features: Place bid page displays all details of the car and includes a form for user input. If the user enters a bid which is lower than 90% of the asking price, a warning will be displayed that the bid is too low. This prompts user to try another bid. If the bid is accepted, the car is removed from inventory and user is directed to details for finalizing the purchase and picking up the car.

#### Searching for a Particular Vehicle

Details: User can search for a particular car by model and new or used. Only models currently in the inventory will be displayed for users to choose from. All results will be returned to user as cards for view (with option to bid if 120+ days). If a user selects a model and new/used combo that is not available in the inventory, they will be notified and asked to try another search.
